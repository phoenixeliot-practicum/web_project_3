          Need more action and adventure in your life instead of the same old routine? From Portland, Maine to Portland,
          Oregon we're going to take you on an exciting journey through some unknown regions of your country. Leave the
          car at home and travel by bike starting in New England where it all began. You will pass through 12 beautiful
          states, covering a total of 3,600 miles, and accomplish 3 monumental missions. Partying and taking a selfie
          with a famous rock star, donating $1 to a billionaire to help eradicate polio in Africa, and even stopping by
          famous author Stephen King's house to say hi and asking him to sign your favorite book.

                Still, as sparsely populated as it was in the 1600s, this is an extraordinary and highly underrated
                state
                full of rich history and majestic natural beauty. Maine is the main state you want to be sure not to
                miss.
                As your journey is going to be a long one, you had best be prepared for an arduous trek.
              </p>
              <p class="place__paragraph">
                Thankfully, not only is Maine home to the very first European settlers on US territory in the era of
                Vikings, but is also home to L.L. Bean, which is a great company to grab a super sturdy backpack from
                for
                your 3-month expedition.

                There's no better place to lose yourself in nature than in springtime New Hampshire. As serene and
                beautiful as it was in the 1700s, this state is still much less traveled than its neighbors to the
                South.
                So enjoy it while it lasts.

                You won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it make sense to pick up some extra footwear?
                Fortunately for you, the best outdoor shoe company in the history of the world proudly hails from this
                state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in Stratham, and pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof boots
                to
                keep your feet dry. Fitting for unpredictable weather you may be confronted by while passing through the
                Appalachians. These boots are also better than cycling shoes when pitching a tent.

                Erie, Pennsylvania, not to be confused with the word “eerie,” although it can be from time to time, is
                another town worth passing through for several different reasons. While it might be most famously known
                as
                the scene of the Gettysburg address delivered by Mr. Lincoln during the Civil war, Pennsylvania also has
                produced a rather decent-sized Amish community (eerie, huh?)

              <p class="place__paragraph">
                The reason we've brought you here today, if you haven't already guessed, can be summed up by using one
                delicious word: chocolate. Hershey's is a Pennsylvania-based company. Most likely, one of the tastiest
                missions you'll ever embark on during this tour, try to find an Amish friend and enjoy a bar in the
                National Wildlife Refuge on your way to Erie and have an extra eerie time!

                From the college capital of Columbus to the clean coastline of Cleveland, Ohio is a truly hidden gem.
                Earthquakes are surprisingly common in this particular region of North America, over 200 of which have
                registered with a magnitude of 2 or higher since 1776. However, earthquakes aren't the only thing
                shaking
                this centrally located state. One of the country's largest and oldest roller coaster parks is waiting to
                ROCK your world in Sandusky, Ohio! This will presumably be one of the most thrilling quests you'll ever
                complete (provided you can stomach it). Take a much-deserved break to ride as many roller coasters as
                you
                can before continue your bike ride!
